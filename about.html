                    The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                    Celebrations
                    are
                    concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday the
                    start
                    of lent in
                    the Western Christian tradition. Usually there is one major parade each day weather permitting; many
                    days
                    have
                    several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the
                    Mardi
                    Gras season. In
                    the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including
                    parades
                    and
                    balls some
                    of them masquerade balls. <br><br>

                    The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                    parade
                    schedule and route
                    each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
                    Knights
                    of Momus and
                    the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
                    events,
                    such as the
                    Krewe of Endymion which is best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades,
                    the
                    Krewe of Bacchus
                    similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings, as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure
                    Club—a
                    predominantly
                    African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common
                    throws
                    are
                    strings of
                    colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive
                    toys.
                    Major krewes
                    follow the same parade schedule and route each year. <br><br>

                    While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                    originate
                    in
                    the Uptown and
                    Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side
                    of
                    the
                    French
                    Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place
                    downtown in
                    the
                    Faubourg
                    Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally
                    concludes
                    with the
                    "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>

                    The Rex pageant, Mardi Gras Day, New Orleans, La., c. 1907
                    The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi
                    River
                    in
                    what is now
                    lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                    celebrated it
                    as
                    part of an
                    observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans
                    is
                    unknown. A 1730
                    account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming including
                    cross-dressing.
                    Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was
                    already
                    established.
                    Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes
                    prohibited
                    by
                    law, and
                    were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard
                    Xavier
                    de
                    Marigny de
                    Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras
                    celebration.

                    James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New
                    Orleans
                    Mardi
                    Gras. <br><br> in
                    1835:

                    Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
                    frolic,
                    and comic
                    masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and
                    boys,
                    women and
                    girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in
                    grotesque,
                    quizzical,
                    diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and
                    birds,
                    beasts and birds
                    with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats
                    from
                    the
                    moon;
                    mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons,
                    carts,
                    coaches, cars,
                    &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming,
                    fiddling,
                    fifeing, and
                    all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way. <br><br>

                    In 1856, 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society
                    to
                    observe
                    Mardi Gras
                    with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick Krewe of Comus.
                    According to one
                    historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always
                    considered
                    a
                    French
                    festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday
                    had
                    passed from
                    French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans
                    and
                    its
                    Creoles.
                    <br><br>
                    To a
                    certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting
                    of
                    how
                    their business
                    prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized
                    Carnival
                    passed from
                    Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth
                    century.
                    The
                    spectacle of
                    Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the
                    ballrooms
                    and
                    on the
                    streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely
                    American."

                    In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.War, economic, political, and weather
                    conditions
                    sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil
                    War,
                    World
                    War I and
                    World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.

                    The 1898 Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co.
                    The
                    rumored but
                    long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including
                    one
                    transporting a
                    live ox.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or
                    moved to
                    surrounding
                    communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to
                    the
                    city.
                    Masking,
                    costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order.
                    Guardsmen
                    prevented crimes
                    against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for
                    these
                    reasons, some
                    in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations,
                    including
                    Mardi
                    Gras
                    Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or
                    sexual
                    orientation,
                    to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was passed, the city
                    demanded
                    that these
                    krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and
                    the
                    distinctly
                    private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it
                    jurisdiction
                    to
                    demand
                    otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus
                    did
                    parade in
                    the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule
                    in
                    2000.
                    <br><br>
                    Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two
                    federal
                    courts later
                    declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free
                    association, and an
                    unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance. The US Supreme Court
                    refused
                    to hear the
                    city's appeal from this decision.

                    Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays
                    dues,
                    and any member
                    can have a place on a parade float.

                    Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier
                    University of
                    Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive training program at the
                    Harvard
                    Kennedy
                    School.
                    <br>
                    Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she
                    joined
                    the board of the
                    Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004. After the 2005
                    levee
                    failures in
                    Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and
                    remained mostly
                    deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon
                    panel
                    convened by
                    then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans
                    neighborhoods to be
                    converted into greenspace. In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with
                    residents
                    and local
                    religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist
                    returning
                    Broadmoor
                    residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.

                    Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and
                    fellow
                    residents formed
                    the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson school.
                    She
                    served as a
                    founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development corporation
                    that
                    provided case
                    management and other social services for returning residents. She was involved with residents'
                    efforts
                    to reopen
                    Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment. She
                    created a
                    partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which
                    provided
                    the
                    neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer groups.She also formed a partnership
                    between the
                    Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the
                    Broadmoor Art and
                    Wellness Center.
                    <br>Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to replace
                    term-limited mayor Mitch
                    Landrieu. An open primary was held on October 14 and included 18 candidates. Cantrell garnered the
                    most
                    votes,
                    winning 39% of the total. In the November 18 runoff election, Cantrell defeated fellow Democratic
                    opponent Desiree
                    Charbonnet, a former municipal judge, with 60% of the vote. She is the first woman to lead New
                    Orleans
                    in its 300-year
                    history, as well as the first mayor not born in the city since Vic Schiro.
                    <br>
                    Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                    history. Once
                    in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic
                    plan to address
                    families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
                    finding solutions to
                    violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city
                    use,
                    Cantrell has
                    focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public
                    parks, and green
                    spaces.As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against
                    four
                    opioid
                    manufacturers and distributors.

                    During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement
                    with
                    Governor John
                    Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront
                    funding
                    for the city's
                    infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city. Following the
                    approval of the
                    Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Cantrell and the City Council
                    put
                    on the ballot
                    in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term
                    rental
                    properties, as
                    well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.
                    <br>
                    Cantrell was re-elected to office by a wide margin in November 2021, securing 65% of the vote. Her
                    campaign focused
                    on the city's status in 2020 as a COVID-19 hotspot and her efforts, which at times were unpopular,
                    to
                    stop the disease's
                    spread. She also stressed the need for higher-paying jobs for city workers, better public health
                    outcomes and new
                    technologies for the future of New Orleans.
