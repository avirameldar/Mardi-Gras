                        <p>Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on January 6
                            (see question below) and ends
                            on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash Wednesday when Lent begins.
                            It is also common for
                            people to refer to the entire season as Mardi Gras and, for clarity, to call Fat Tuesday
                            "Mardi Gras Day." Locals tend
                            to call the season "Carnival" and, to us, the last two weekends leading up to Tuesday
                            are"Mardi Gras."

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb. 24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus.
                            They began the tradition of
                            presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the krewe and their guests.

                        <p>Rex, the King of Carnival, selected the Mardi Gras colors and assigned meaning to them in
                            1892. Purple stands for
                            justice, green for faith, and gold for power.

                        <p>By law, float riders must always have a mask on. On Fat Tuesday, masking is legal for
                            everyone else, and the elaborate
                            masks that some wear add to the fun.

                        <p>The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some krewes hold random drawings,
                            while others invite a
                            celebrity guest to be their king. Rex, the King of Carnival, is chosen by the School of
                            Design, who sponsors the Rex
                            parade. His identity is revealed the day before the parade.

                            parade's theme, costumes and unique throws. Each Carnival Club, as they are known, is
                            individually funded by its
                            members. They support their krewe through dues, sales of krewe-related merchandise to their
                            members, and fundraising.
                            Mardi Gras parade krewes sometimes have corporate sponsors.

                            The city of New Orleans is not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades; their only
                            involvement is to issue parade
                            permits to each individual Mardi Gras krewe that schedules and coordinates its own parade.
